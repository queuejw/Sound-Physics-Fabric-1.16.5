# Sound-Physics

**!!! REQUIRES Cloth Config !!!**

A Minecraft mod that provides realistic sound attenuation, reverberation, and absorption through blocks. (By the means of cheap ray tracing)

Ported to 1.17 fabric by vlad2305m featuring some improvements by daipenjer (I only found one 1.16 fabric fork which is just the example mod, so I believe this one is unique)

Notice: You will not spot the difference until you turn up the config. Only a very small difference is there initially, and it is hard to spot because it feels very natual.

My favourites: decrease attenuation rolloff to < 0.5; increase global reflectivity to ~1.8
Feel free to submit your favourites for me to create config presets.
